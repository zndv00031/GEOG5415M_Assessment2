## NO2 Exposure and Neighbourhood Deprivation
This project looks into whether deprivation per neighbourhood in Leeds, is linked to higher exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), commonly polluted by vechiles. Any hidden patterns are also being looked out for. This project uses open spatial data to support insight.

## Research Questions
- Is neighbourhood deprivation associated with higher NO2 exposure in Leeds?
- Does the spatial distribution of monitoring bias the relationship between deprivation and pollution?
- Does using a complete modelled surface (DEFRA PCM) reveal hidden patterns?

## Data Sources
All data is available and cited in the notebook, which is gained from external sources:

- DEFRA – Pollution Climate Mapping (PCM) NO2
- Leeds City Council – NO2 diffusion tubes (Datamill North)
- Office for National Statistics – LSOA 2021 boundaries
- ONS – LSOA11 → LSOA21 → LAD22 exact-fit lookup
- MHCLG – Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD 2019)
